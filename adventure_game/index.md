# Progress: The Beginnings
---

Eagerly awaiting the potential -- but not probable -- next installment of *Ace Attorney* (please Capcom!), **Jenny** and **Diana** decided to take matters into their own hands to bring you a new mystery adventure. *Untitled Game* is a game that combines the classic mystery novel with social simulation and puzzle elements. It's funny, charming, and most importantly, thrilling. 

Detailed updates on the game's progress can be found on our [developer blog](https://t-jenny.github.io/categories/dev-blog/).

## My Role

---

With minimal coding experience and no art or composing experience, I decided quarantine was the best time to tackle something as difficult and intimidating as game making. I am currently coding, drawing, and composing, and my friend, Diana, is writing.

## Gameplay

### *Manage Y's Time*

√Å la *Persona*, people are expecting certain qualities from Y before she can charge into an interview. Develop Y by planning her free time, as she needs knowledge, charm, strength, ingenuity, and empathy to find uncover the truth. Y's character growth will influence how the story unfolds.

### *Talk with Townies*

Townspeople will only start opening up about the inner workings of X once they get to know you a little. Spending time with townspeople just might unlock some important testimony or clues.

### *Take Notes*
Notes are a journalist's best friend, and Y will not be able to ask the tough questions if she does not remember what was said in the past. Writing down important facts in her handy-dandy notebook will unlock conversation paths that bring Y closer to the truth.
