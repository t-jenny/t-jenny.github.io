As someone who obsessed over Harvest Moon since I played More Friends of Mineral Town in middle school, I was surprised by the popularity of Stardew Valley. Youtubers, Twitch streamers, and even my brother, a long-time critic of my video game tastes, loved this game. How did a seemingly random farming simulator manage to win over even the most obstinate casual game haters? Abigail crushing at the flute\" Abigail crushing at the flute After I spent 20 hours on the game, it was clear that these new farming sim converts never gave Harvest Moon a chance. From the music to the graphics to the villagers’ personalities, Stardew Valley IS a Harvest Moon game with all its staples including farming (obviously), house upgrades, friendship levels, festivals, and even mining combat (first introduced in Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon). That is not to say Stardew Valley does not have its own merits; in fact, it is better than any Harvest Moon title to date. With its customization options, interesting characters, and hidden secrets, Stardew Valley has tweaked every aspect of the Harvest Moon formula to create a more mature and satisfying farming sim.

After a few days, the mayor expresses his desire to re-engage the community by restoring the community center. With an encroaching JojaMart right next door (and a smarmy manager to boot), you can either destroy the center and replace it with a Joja warehouse or complete item bundles to repair the building. The game makes it pretty clear which one is “morally right,” but the choice is yours. From there, you shape your own story: build your own winery; conquer the mines; date the local hot girl from high school; become the multi-millionaire you are destined to be.

The bundles consist of almost every item in the game from produce to fish to money. Your main source of income and gifts will come from your crops and livestock which can be purchased in town. As you level up your skills, you will unlock item blueprints, and soon you will be turning your milk into cheese, eggs into mayonnaise, and grapes into wine. Unique to Stardew Valley, you can place your equipment wherever you want on your property. With an overwhelming amount of land to customize, you can spend hours designing and redesigning your farm. Monsters at the mine\" Monsters at the mine Mining provides rare items and ores essential for blueprints and tool upgrades, but be extra careful of your health and stamina! If you pass out in the mines, not only will you lose hard-earned cash, but you will lose progress in your mining descent. Fishing is a great way to find ingredients for recipes and gifts for villagers, and the mini-game is surprisingly difficult (a nice change of pace compared to classic j-RPGs and Animal Crossing). Unlike some past Harvest Moon games (…Story of Seasons), I never find myself sleeping at 6pm due to lack of/gated content. Tickling by compulsive desire to optimize my gameplay, Stardew Valley has so much to do I plan days, weeks, in advance, constantly justifying my “Oh, but one more day!\" cry at 3am. Additionally Stardew Valley’s creator, Eric Barone, has proven himself to be an amazing game developer who frequently publishes free updates to the game including additional marriage candidates, events, and late game farming mechanics. For more information, you can visit Barone’s developer blog.

Abigail is actually Spyro\" Abigail is actually Spyro As you talk to villagers, you will encounter special cutscenes that reveal more about a character’s personality. Regardless of your gender, there are 5 bachelor and 5 bachelorettes that you can marry. These characters have more frequent and fleshed out cutscenes and need a bouquet to pass 8 friendship hearts. As a fan of game worlds that extend beyond the player (à la Legend of Heroes), I enjoy seeing the townspeople hangout with their friends without you (e.g. Friday night outings, weekly yoga sessions). My one wish is Stardew Valley included the marriage rivalry system of prior Harvest Moon games which paired up each bachelor/bachelorette, resulting in its own cutscene path. The changing relationships between townspeople gave the world an extra sense of progression that I am still missing.

The new Story of Seasons games are still experimenting with different mechanics, and if you really like Stardew Valley, I recommend supporting the brand – I highly doubt that these games are making bank.

QR codes are offered when watching the Yo-Kai Watch anime on Disney X-D or when purchasing action figures and collectible coins. The internet has to work together to capture randomly generated criminals and piece together the weekly password. Level-5 always delivers on graphics and presentation. The character movement is incredibly smooth. The color is vibrant and charming. The music is bouncy and fun. The attention to detail is out of this world: you can buy soda from the soda machines; jaywalking is frowned upon; even the loading screen is cute. After completing a sidequest, you get to watch a random little cutscene; the scene is always amusing (one involves all of the old Yo-Kai playing mini golf), and depending on the scene’s outcome, you might even receive a rare bonus item.

Catching rare critters is nearly impossible. In order to even find a rare fish or bug, you have to inspect every single tree or river in the entire forest.

To up those chances, you can feed a Yo-Kai its favorite food once during the battle. First, you must first figure out what its favorite food is, and if that is not difficult enough, it can take several battles before even the weakest Yo-Kai joins you. It took me 10 battles before catch Slush, an E-rank Yo-kai. Just imagine how many times I would have to battle a Rank S Yo-Kai (and how many cheeseburgers or liver and chive plates I would have to feed it)! Unforunately with its battle system, the grind is just boring. The player takes the backseat as the Yo-Kai work.(The fast-forward button will be your best friend.) Players can rotate between six Yo-Kai and activate a Yo-Kai’s soultimate move by either tapping a few times, drawing a few circles, or tracing a few lines.
